              a part of our team, earn market-leading pay and benefits, and gain 
              the freedom to choose when and where they work.</p>

              best-in-class hospitals. We expect a lot from our vets, so the same applies 
              to our hospitals. We partner with hospitals that not only have high medical 
              standards, but also have a commitment to maintaining a healthy workplace for 
              staff and patients.</p>
